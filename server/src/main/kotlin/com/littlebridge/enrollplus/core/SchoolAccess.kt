/*
 * File: SchoolAccess.kt
 * Module: core
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   Single source of truth for school-side authorization & scoping. Before this
 *   existed, every *Routing.kt file declared its own private `resolveSchoolId`
 *   and most mutations were id-only (a caller from school A could mutate a row
 *   belonging to school B if they knew its id).
 *
 *   This module centralizes:
 *     - principal parsing (UUID + role)
 *     - school resolution from app_users.school_id
 *     - a guard that requires an authenticated school-admin WITH a school
 *     - ownership checks so every mutation/read is scoped to the caller's school
 *
 * Roles allowed to operate on the school surface:
 *   "school_admin"  – the school owner created during onboarding
 *   "school_staff"  – delegated staff (future-proofing; treated as school role)
 *   "admin"         – platform super-admin (full access)
 *
 * Usage in a route handler:
 *   val ctx = call.requireSchoolContext() ?: return@get   // responds 401/403 itself
 *   // ctx.userId, ctx.schoolId, ctx.role are now trusted
