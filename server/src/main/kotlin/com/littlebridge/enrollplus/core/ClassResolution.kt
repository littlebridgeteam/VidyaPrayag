/*
 * File: ClassResolution.kt
 * Module: core
 *
 * ROOT FIX (ISSUE 1) — write-side half of the class normalisation.
 *
 * [ClassNaming] gives us a comparable KEY for a class label. This object uses
 * that key to resolve a free-text class label an admin typed back to the
 * school's CANONICAL `school_classes.name`, so the value we persist in
 * `students.class_name` is byte-for-byte identical to the value stored in
 * `teacher_subject_assignments.class_name` (which is itself the canonical
 * school_classes.name). With both ends storing the canonical string, the derived
 * teacher⇄student join holds with a plain equality and never silently drops.
 *
 * If a typed class doesn't resolve to a configured class (e.g. the school never
 * created it), we fall back to a cleaned-up version of what was typed
 * (whitespace-collapsed) so nothing is rejected outright — but a configured
 * class always wins, which is what makes the relationship chain connect.
