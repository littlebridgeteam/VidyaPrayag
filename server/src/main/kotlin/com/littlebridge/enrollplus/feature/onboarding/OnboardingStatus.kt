/*
 * File: OnboardingStatus.kt
 * Module: feature.onboarding
 *
 * Purpose:
 *   THE single source of truth for "how far along is this school's onboarding".
 *   Before this, three places computed completion three different ways:
 *     - UserDetailsRouting : real school fields + school_classes count + onboarded_at  (correct)
 *     - SchoolDashboard    : "a draft row exists for this step"                          (too loose)
 *     - Onboarding submit  : "is_final_submission && step==REVIEW"                       (only the end)
 *
 *   Every caller now derives status from the SAME persisted facts, and — after
 *   the onboarding-redirect fix — from the EXPLICIT per-step completion ledger
 *   `schools.onboarding_steps_done`:
 *     Step 1 BASIC     -> "BASIC" in ledger (admin submitted Step 1) OR a legacy
 *                         row already has substantive wizard data (classes)
 *     Step 2 BRANDING  -> "BRANDING" in ledger OR substantive wizard data
 *     Step 3 ACADEMIC  -> >= 1 row in school_classes for this school
 *     Step 4 REVIEW    -> onboarded_at stamped AND BASIC + ACADEMIC genuinely done
 *
 *   THE BUG THIS FIXES: self-registration (`POST /auth/register-school`)
 *   pre-creates a fully-named `schools` row at signup. Deriving "BASIC done"
 *   from "a named school row exists" therefore marked a brand-new school's
 *   Step 1 complete, and the gate resumed the wizard at ACADEMIC (frontend
 *   Step 3), skipping the required earlier steps. Completion is now driven by
 *   the ledger (written ONLY when the admin submits a step) plus substantive
 *   data — never by a registration placeholder.
 *
 *   "Draft presence" is still NOT used for completion — drafts are only for
 *   restoring half-typed form state; the ledger is the authoritative signal.

/**
 * PURE onboarding-state derivation — the single, testable source of truth for
 * "how far along is this school's onboarding", shared by every surface
 * (`GET /onboarding/status`, the dashboard, user details).
 *
 * Inputs are the RAW persisted facts:
 *   - [schoolExists]   : a `schools` row is linked to the user.
 *   - [ledger]         : steps the admin ACTUALLY submitted in the wizard
 *                        (`schools.onboarding_steps_done`). Written ONLY by
 *                        `/onboarding/submit` + `/complete` — NEVER at
 *                        registration. This is what fixes the redirect bug:
 *                        a freshly self-registered school has an empty ledger,
 *                        so "a named school row exists" no longer marks BASIC
 *                        done and the wizard correctly resumes at Step 1.
 *   - [hasClasses]     : ≥1 row in `school_classes` (registration never creates
 *                        these → trustworthy independent signal for ACADEMIC,
 *                        and a defensive fallback for legacy pre-ledger rows).
 *   - [logoPresent]    : a branding logo exists (best-effort BRANDING signal).
 *   - [stampPresent]   : `schools.onboarded_at` is set.
 *
 * Defensive against bad/legacy data:
 *   - A bare `onboarded_at` stamp on an otherwise-empty row does NOT complete
 *     onboarding — REVIEW also requires BASIC + ACADEMIC to genuinely exist.
 *   - Legacy rows that pre-date the ledger still resolve correctly because real
 *     classes imply BASIC/BRANDING were done.
