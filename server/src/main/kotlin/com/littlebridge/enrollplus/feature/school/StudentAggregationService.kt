 *
 * RA-SP: the CENTRALIZED student aggregation service — the single source of
 * truth for every derived student/teacher/parent metric so the platform never
 * shows stale data.
 *
 * The school domain stores facts (students, teacher_subject_assignments,
 * parent_child_links, attendance_records, assessments + marks). Counts and
 * relationships that the UI needs — "how many teachers does this student have",
 * "how many students does this teacher have", "who are this student's parents",
 * "what is this student's attendance %" — are NOT stored as columns (which would
 * inevitably drift). Instead they are DERIVED on demand from those facts, in ONE
 * place, here. Every read path (student roster, student profile, teacher
 * profile) and every write path (add student, move class) funnels its
 * aggregation through this service, which guarantees:
 *
 *   • Teacher → student counts are always recomputed from the live roster, so
 *     adding/moving a student is reflected instantly with no manual updates.
 *   • Student → teachers are always derived from the class+section assignments,
 *     so a teacher-assignment change updates every affected student profile.
 *   • Student → parents are always read from the approved parent_child_links,
 *     with AT MOST ONE primary guardian enforced per student.
 *
 * Every function here is pure with respect to the DB transaction it runs in:
 * call them from inside `dbQuery { ... }`. They never write unless explicitly
 * named `…recalc…`/`enforce…`.
