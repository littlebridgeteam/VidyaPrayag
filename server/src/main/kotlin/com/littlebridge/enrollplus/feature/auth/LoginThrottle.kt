/*
 * File: LoginThrottle.kt
 * Module: feature.auth
 *
 * RA-41: a lightweight, in-memory sliding-window throttle for the email/password
 * login path. The OTP path is already rate-limited (OtpService resend cap +
 * lockout), but `/login` with email+password had NO throttle, leaving it open to
 * unthrottled credential stuffing.
 *
 * Design:
 *   - Two independent windows are checked per attempt: one keyed by client IP
 *     and one keyed by the (normalised) identifier. A request is blocked if
 *     EITHER window is over its cap — this throttles both "spray many accounts
 *     from one IP" and "hammer one account from many IPs".
 *   - A successful login clears the identifier window so a legitimate user who
 *     finally types the right password isn't penalised by their earlier typos.
 *   - Sliding window: timestamps older than the window are dropped on each touch,
 *     so there is no fixed-bucket boundary an attacker can game.
 *   - In-memory + ConcurrentHashMap: process-local, zero new dependencies and no
 *     schema change. For a single-instance deployment this is sufficient; a
 *     multi-instance deployment can later swap this for a shared store behind the
 *     same `check`/`recordFailure`/`recordSuccess` surface.
 *
 * Tunables (env, with safe defaults):
 *   LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS      max failed attempts per window per key   (default 8)
 *   LOGIN_WINDOW_SECONDS    sliding-window length in seconds         (default 900 = 15m)
