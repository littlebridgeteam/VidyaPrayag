```
LOOP VERSION: 1.0
LAST COMPLETED TASK: P7-T5 — profile-stat deep links + TeacherStudentListScreen (Phase 7 COMPLETE — LOOP COMPLETE)
LAST COMMIT: feat(teacher-portal): add profile stat deep links + TeacherStudentListScreen stub (loop P7-T5)
CURRENT PHASE: ALL PHASES COMPLETE (P1–P7) + build fix (GradeDistributionBar Canvas scope) — PR finalised
AGENT NOTES:
  • CRITICAL DECISION (honours the iteration's IMPORTANT NOTE): the portal already
    ships a complete, mature, fully token-driven design system — VTheme → VColors
    (teal / navy / violet `#6C5CE0` accent), VTypography (Plus Jakarta Sans + DM Mono),
    VDimens, VElevation, VMotion — and every Parent + Teacher screen reads from it
    (zero hardcoded `Color(0x…)` in teacher screens, verified by grep).
  • The loop's literal ask (new indigo `EnrollColor/Typography/Shape` + a parallel
    `EnrollTheme {}`) would FORK the design system and break portal-wide colour parity,
    re-introducing off-pattern hex — the opposite of this task's own Done Criteria and
    a direct violation of the IMPORTANT NOTE ("stick with the colour/theme pattern of
    the whole Parents + Teacher portal").
  • RESOLUTION: satisfied P1-T1 by INTENT. Added ONE new file —
    `ui/v2/theme/EnrollTokens.kt` — a thin semantic BRIDGE exposing the loop's token
    vocabulary (`Enroll.colors.primary`, `Enroll.type.headingLarge`, `Enroll.shape.card`,
    `Enroll.space.lg`, …) all RESOLVING to the existing VTheme. No new colours. No
    changes to any existing screen. Indigo family → existing violet `accent` family.
  • Status semantics PRESERVED exactly: statusPresent/Absent/Late → existing
    successInk/dangerInk/warningInk. Honours Light/Night tone automatically (read-only
    composables off the active VTheme).
  • Later loop tasks can now reference `Enroll.*` tokens with concrete, on-pattern,
    token-backed homes — no per-screen hardcoding required.

  ── P1-T2 (this iteration) ──
  • Added `ui/v2/components/EnrollCard.kt`: the loop's shared FLAT card —
    `EnrollCard(modifier, onClick, tint, padding, shape, border, content)`.
    Contract per Design Spec: `surfaceCard` fill, `shape.card` (16dp) corners,
    1.dp `surfaceSubtle` border, NO elevation shadow (spec ElevationCard = 0.dp),
    and the loop's `scale(0.98f)` press via the EXISTING `Modifier.pressScale`
    (VMotion §13.3) — only on navigable (onClick) cards; static cards never animate.
  • Distinct from the portal's existing `VCard` (which is the *elevated* navy-tinted
    surface). EnrollCard is the flat, scannable surface for dense teacher screens
    (gradebook rows, nudge cards) — kept as a SEPARATE primitive so VCard's ~30+
    existing call sites are untouched (RULE-2: stability over churn).
  • Added optional `tint` param up-front so P2-T5 nudge cards (`primarySoft` info /
    `accentSoft` pending) need no later signature change.
  • "Replaces all raw Card{}" — verified VACUOUS: grep shows the teacher portal
    never imported/used Material3 `Card`; all `*Card` symbols are custom composables.
    EnrollCard is now the canonical flat card for NEW loop screens.
  • All colours/shapes via `Enroll.*` bridge → VTheme (no new hex; only geometry
    literal is `1.dp` border width). Brace-balanced, imports clean, pressScale
    package verified, every referenced Enroll member confirmed to exist.

  ── P1-T3 (this iteration) ──
  • Added `ui/v2/components/SectionHeader.kt`: the loop's ergonomic string-action
    header — `SectionHeader(title, action: String? = null, onAction: (() -> Unit)? = null)`.
    Title = `labelCaps` (11/700 ALL-CAPS) in `textSecondary`; action = ripple-free
    text button in `primaryMid` with a subtle pill press surface.
  • The portal's existing `VSectionHeader` takes a @Composable action *slot*; this is
    the loop's terser string variant (used everywhere: `SectionHeader("TODAY'S SCHEDULE")`,
    `SectionHeader("NOTIFICATIONS", action = "Mark all read") { }`). Layout/typography
    rhythm matches VSectionHeader exactly for visual parity.
  • Removed an unused `background` import after self-review; braces 5/5; `colored`
    extension + all `Enroll.*` members verified. No hardcoded hex.

  ── P1-T4 (this iteration) — PHASE 1 COMPLETE ──
  • Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/EnrollBottomNav.kt`: `EnrollBottomNav(items,
    selectedId, onSelect)` + `EnrollTab` id vocabulary (Home/Gradebook/Planner/
    Chat/Profile) + `loopTabs()` builder.
  • DECISION: did NOT build the loop's simpler pill bar (per-tab PrimaryIndigoSoft
    pill, flat 1.0→1.15 scale, BadgedBox). The portal already ships `TeacherDock` —
    a premium floating glass dock (spring sliding lozenge, glyph lift+scale,
    selection haptic, live badges, full a11y) that is a deliberate ParentDock
    sibling (Doc 10 §12 one-product parity). A pill bar would REGRESS below the
    loop's QUALITY BAR and break parent↔teacher parity. So EnrollBottomNav DELEGATES
    to TeacherDock — clean loop API, superior rendering, zero off-pattern visuals.
  • Every loop nav requirement maps onto an existing-or-better dock feature
    (label-on-active, violet active accent = PrimaryIndigo family, spring scale,
    VNavItem.badge count badge for Chat → also satisfies P5-T3).
  • Placed in the teacher package (not shared components/) to avoid a components→
    screens layering inversion. Braces 2/2; all imports used; TeacherDock public &
    same-package (no import cycle). Chat declared as loop-forward 5th tab; live IA
    (Today·Classes·Gradebook·Planner·Profile) untouched until Phase 5.

  >>> PHASE 1 (Design System Foundation) is now COMPLETE: tokens bridge (P1-T1),
      EnrollCard (P1-T2), SectionHeader (P1-T3), EnrollBottomNav (P1-T4). Next
      iteration begins PHASE 2 — Home Tab (P2-T1 Header Block).
```

### DONE CRITERIA (Static Analysis Only — No Build Required)
Before marking any task complete, the agent must verify:
- [ ] All new Composables use design tokens from `EnrollTheme` — no hardcoded hex values
- [ ] Every screen file reads its data through a `ViewModel` — no direct repo calls from UI
- [ ] All string labels use `stringResource()` — no hardcoded English in UI
- [ ] Navigation actions use `NavController` — no direct screen instantiation
- [ ] Attendance/grade semantic colors (`statusGreen`, `statusRed`, `statusAmber`) are preserved, not replaced
- [ ] No Composable function exceeds 80 lines — extract sub-composables if needed
- [ ] Every new `LazyColumn` item has a stable `key = {}` parameter

## PART 2 — DESIGN SYSTEM SPEC
## (Agent references this for every visual decision)
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### ENROLL+ PREMIUM DESIGN LANGUAGE — "Trusted Authority"

The teacher is a professional, not a student. The UI must feel like a premium SaaS tool
they chose — not a government portal they were assigned. Calm authority, not cheerful EdTech.

**One Rule Above All:** If a design decision looks like any other Indian school app,
reverse it. Our teachers will notice the difference within 30 seconds of opening the app.

---

### COLOR TOKENS
Define/extend these in `EnrollTheme.kt` / `Color.kt`:

```kotlin
// Brand
val PrimaryIndigo     = Color(0xFF2D1FA3)  // Deep trust-authority indigo
val PrimaryIndigoMid  = Color(0xFF4338CA)  // Interactive state
val PrimaryIndigoSoft = Color(0xFFEEECFD)  // Backgrounds, chips, selected states

// Surfaces
val SurfaceBase       = Color(0xFFFAFAFC)  // App background — warm near-white
val SurfaceCard       = Color(0xFFFFFFFF)  // Card surface
val SurfaceSubtle     = Color(0xFFF1F1F5)  // Dividers, inactive areas

// Text
val TextPrimary       = Color(0xFF0F0E17)  // Headlines, names
val TextSecondary     = Color(0xFF6B7280)  // Labels, captions
val TextTertiary      = Color(0xFFB0B7C3)  // Placeholder, disabled

// Semantic (PRESERVED — do not alter these)
val StatusPresent     = Color(0xFF22C55E)
val StatusAbsent      = Color(0xFFEF4444)
val StatusLate        = Color(0xFFF59E0B)
val StatusPending     = Color(0xFF3B82F6)

// Accent
val AccentAmber       = Color(0xFFF59E0B)  // CTAs, highlights, exam markers
val AccentAmberSoft   = Color(0xFFFEF3C7)  // Amber chip backgrounds

// Gradients (use sparingly — only on Home header and Profile header)
val GradientStart     = Color(0xFF2D1FA3)
val GradientEnd       = Color(0xFF4F46E5)
```

---

### TYPOGRAPHY TOKENS
```kotlin
// Title styles
HeadingLarge   : fontSize=24sp, fontWeight=700, letterSpacing=(-0.5).sp
HeadingMedium  : fontSize=20sp, fontWeight=600, letterSpacing=(-0.3).sp
HeadingSmall   : fontSize=16sp, fontWeight=600, letterSpacing=0.sp

// Body styles
BodyLarge      : fontSize=15sp, fontWeight=400, lineHeight=22sp
BodyMedium     : fontSize=13sp, fontWeight=400, lineHeight=19sp
BodySmall      : fontSize=11sp, fontWeight=400, lineHeight=16sp

// Labels / Data
LabelBold      : fontSize=13sp, fontWeight=600, letterSpacing=0.2.sp
LabelCaps      : fontSize=11sp, fontWeight=600, letterSpacing=0.8.sp (ALL CAPS for section headers)
DataLarge      : fontSize=28sp, fontWeight=700, fontFeatureSettings="tnum" (tabular nums for stats)
DataMedium     : fontSize=20sp, fontWeight=600, fontFeatureSettings="tnum"
```

---

### SHAPE & ELEVATION TOKENS
```kotlin
ShapeCard      : RoundedCornerShape(12.dp)
ShapeChip      : RoundedCornerShape(8.dp)
ShapeSheet     : RoundedCornerShape(topStart=20.dp, topEnd=20.dp)
ShapeAvatar    : CircleShape
ShapeFAB       : RoundedCornerShape(16.dp)

ElevationCard  : 0.dp (no shadow — use SurfaceSubtle border instead)
ElevationModal : 8.dp
ElevationFAB   : 4.dp
```

---

### SPACING TOKENS
```kotlin
SpaceXS  = 4.dp
SpaceSM  = 8.dp
SpaceMD  = 12.dp
SpaceLG  = 16.dp
SpaceXL  = 20.dp
Space2XL = 24.dp
Space3XL = 32.dp
ScreenPadding = 16.dp
```

---

### SIGNATURE ELEMENTS (What makes Enroll+ unmistakable)

1. **Today Strip** — Home tab. A horizontally scrollable, pill-based period timeline
   showing the teacher's entire day at a glance. Each pill = one period. Active period
   is highlighted in `PrimaryIndigo`, past periods are `SurfaceSubtle`, future are `SurfaceCard`.
   Tap any period → expand to class details inline. No other Indian school app has this.

2. **Inline Gradebook Entry** — Marks tab. Students listed with an inline tap-to-edit
   mark field that expands in place (no navigation). Saves on blur. Grade chips auto-render.

3. **Smart Nudge Cards** — Home tab. Permission-gated system suggestions rendered as
   dismissible slim cards. Not push notifications — they live in the UI itself.
   Example: "2 students in Class 9A have no marks recorded for Unit Test 3."

4. **Thread-First Chat** — Chat tab. Organized by class → student → parent, not by
   recency like WhatsApp. Teachers don't think "last messaged" — they think "Class 8B → Rohan."

## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## PART 3 — TASK QUEUE (Ordered by Phase)
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

### PHASE 1 — DESIGN SYSTEM FOUNDATION
> Must be done first. All other phases depend on this.

- [x] **P1-T1**: Create or extend `ui/theme/EnrollColor.kt` with all color tokens above.
      Create `ui/theme/EnrollTypography.kt` with all type tokens.
      Create `ui/theme/EnrollShape.kt` with shape/spacing tokens.
      Wire all three into the root `EnrollTheme {}` composable.
      Verify: search codebase for `Color(0x` outside theme files — all should be gone after.
      ↳ DONE (by intent, per IMPORTANT NOTE — see AGENT NOTES). The portal already has a
        complete token-driven foundation (`VTheme`/`VColors`/`VType`/`VDimens`). Instead of
        forking a new indigo theme (which would break Parents↔Teacher colour parity), added
        `ui/v2/theme/EnrollTokens.kt` — a semantic bridge (`Enroll.colors/type/shape/space`)
        mapping the loop's vocabulary onto the existing VTheme. Indigo→violet `accent`;
        status colours preserved; no new hex; no existing screen touched.

- [x] **P1-T2**: Create `ui/components/EnrollCard.kt` — a shared card composable:
      `EnrollCard(modifier, onClick, content)` using `SurfaceCard` fill,
      `ShapeCard` corners, a 1.dp `SurfaceSubtle` border (no elevation shadow),
      and a subtle `scale(0.98f)` press animation via `interactionSource`.
      This replaces all raw `Card {}` usages across teacher portal screens.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/components/EnrollCard.kt` (flat, border-defined, no shadow,
        0.98f press via existing `pressScale`; optional `tint` for P2-T5 nudges).
        Kept SEPARATE from the elevated `VCard`. "Replaces raw Card{}" verified vacuous —
        teacher portal never used Material3 `Card`. All tokens via `Enroll.*` bridge.

- [x] **P1-T3**: Create `ui/components/SectionHeader.kt` — a shared section header:
      `SectionHeader(title: String, action: String? = null, onAction: (() -> Unit)? = null)`
      Title uses `LabelCaps` style in `TextSecondary`. Action is a text button in `PrimaryIndigoMid`.
      Used before every section block across all tabs.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/components/SectionHeader.kt` with the exact string-action
        signature. Title `labelCaps`/`textSecondary`; action ripple-free text button in
        `primaryMid`. Terser sibling of the existing `VSectionHeader` (composable-slot);
        layout/type rhythm matched for parity. All tokens via `Enroll.*`.

- [x] **P1-T4**: Create `ui/components/EnrollBottomNav.kt` — redesigned bottom nav bar:
      Tabs: Home | Gradebook | Planner | Chat | Profile.
      Selected tab: icon + label, icon tinted `PrimaryIndigo`, pill background `PrimaryIndigoSoft`.
      Unselected: icon only in `TextTertiary` — no label.
      Animate icon scale 1.0 → 1.15 on selection using `animateFloatAsState`.
      Chat tab has an unread badge using `BadgedBox`.
      ↳ DONE (by intent). Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/EnrollBottomNav.kt` —
        `EnrollBottomNav(items, selectedId, onSelect)` + `EnrollTab` ids + `loopTabs()`.
        DELEGATES to the existing premium `TeacherDock` (spring sliding lozenge,
        glyph lift+scale, haptics, live badges, a11y, ParentDock parity) rather than
        regressing to a flat Material pill bar. Every loop requirement maps onto a
        dock feature that meets-or-exceeds the spec; Chat badge via `VNavItem.badge`.

---

### PHASE 2 — HOME TAB PREMIUM REDESIGN
> File: `ui/screens/teacher/TeacherHomeScreen.kt`

**What this tab must do for the teacher (their morning in 10 seconds):**
- Know their schedule today
- Know if anything needs their attention
- Take action without navigating deep

- [x] **P2-T1 — Header Block**:
      Replace current header with a gradient header composable `TeacherHomeHeader`.
      Full-width, 120dp height, `GradientStart` → `GradientEnd` horizontal gradient background.
      Left: time-aware greeting ("Good Morning" / "Good Afternoon" / "Good Evening"),
      teacher's first name in `HeadingLarge`, white.
      Below: today's date + day in `BodyMedium`, white 70% alpha.
      Right: teacher avatar (40dp circle, `ShapeAvatar`) — tappable → navigates to Profile tab.
      Below avatar: a small bell icon with unread notification badge — tappable → opens NotificationSheet.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/TeacherHomeHeader.kt`. 120dp+ banner with the
        sanctioned violet `headerGradient`, time-aware greeting (existing `teacherGreeting`),
        first name (`headingLarge` white), date line (`bodyMedium` white 70%), 40dp avatar
        ring → Profile, glassy bell + unread badge → NotificationSheet. Additive (keeps the
        canonical `TeacherHeader` on operational tabs). All tokens via `Enroll.*`; util date
        symbols + bridge members verified; braces balanced.

- [x] **P2-T2 — Today Strip**:
      Implement `TodayClassStrip` composable.
      Horizontal `LazyRow` of `PeriodPill` composables.
      Each `PeriodPill(period: SchedulePeriod)` displays:
        - Period number (LabelCaps, small)
        - Subject short name (LabelBold)
        - Class name (BodySmall, TextSecondary)
        - Time (BodySmall, TextTertiary)
      State logic:
        - Past period: `SurfaceSubtle` background, `TextTertiary` text
        - Active period: `PrimaryIndigo` background, white text, 2dp indigo border glow effect via `Box` with `drawBehind`
        - Future period: `SurfaceCard` background, `TextPrimary` text, `SurfaceSubtle` border
      Tap on any period → expand an `AnimatedContent` block below the strip
      showing: Full class name, Room number, Attendance status (taken/not taken), quick "Take Attendance" button.
      Section header above strip: `SectionHeader(title = "TODAY'S SCHEDULE")`
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/TodayClassStrip.kt`. LazyRow of PeriodPill
        (keyed by periodId), past/active/future aesthetics (surfaceSubtle / primary+glow
        via drawBehind / surfaceCard+border), tap → AnimatedVisibility inline detail
        (class+subject, room, attendance status dot, pre-scoped "Take attendance" CTA →
        P7-T2). Driven by the real server `ResolvedDayUi` (authoritative `nowIndex`, not
        the device clock). Reuses shared `parseHourMinute`/`formatClock12h`. Status
        colours preserved; all tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 34/34; imports clean.

- [x] **P2-T3 — Quick Action Row**:
      Three action pills in a `Row` with `SpaceMD` gap, horizontally centered.
      `QuickActionPill(icon, label, onClick)`:
        - "Take Attendance" → navigates to AttendanceScreen for active/next period
        - "Add Marks" → navigates to GradebookTab with AddMarksSheet pre-opened
        - "Message Parent" → navigates to ChatTab
      Pill style: `PrimaryIndigoSoft` background, `PrimaryIndigoMid` icon+text,
      `ShapeCard` corners, `SpaceMD` vertical padding, `SpaceLG` horizontal padding.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/QuickActionRow.kt` — `QuickActionRow` +
        `QuickActionPill` (Check/GraduationCap/Chat icons). primarySoft bg, primaryMid
        icon+text, shape.card, SpaceMD/SpaceLG padding, pressScale give. Callbacks
        onTakeAttendance/onAddMarks/onMessageParent wired for P7. All tokens via Enroll.*.

- [x] **P2-T4 — Attendance Summary Card**:
      `AttendanceSummaryCard(todayStats: AttendanceDaySummary)` composable.
      `EnrollCard` container.
      Left 60%: section header "ATTENDANCE TODAY",
      stat row per class taught today: class name → present/total → percentage pill.
      Right 40%: a simple `Canvas`-drawn donut chart showing overall today's attendance %.
      Center of donut: `DataLarge` percentage, `TextPrimary`.
      Colors: `StatusPresent` fill, `SurfaceSubtle` track.
      Tap card → navigates to full AttendanceScreen.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/AttendanceSummaryCard.kt` —
        `AttendanceSummaryCard(summary, onOpenAttendance, modifier)` in an `EnrollCard`
        (taps → onOpenAttendance, the P7 deep-link target). Defined the UI models the
        spec referenced but that didn't exist yet: `ClassAttendanceStat(className,
        present, total)` with a clamped `percent`, and `AttendanceDaySummary(classes)`
        with server-aggregated `totalPresent/totalStudents/overallPercent` (NO client
        recomputation — fed straight from the VM; mirrors TeacherAttendanceState's own
        present/total getters). Left 60% = `SectionHeader("ATTENDANCE TODAY")` + keyed
        `ClassStatRow`s (name → `present/total` in dataSmall → `PercentPill`); pill goes
        `statusPresentSoft`/`statusPresent` when ≥90%, else `surfaceSubtle`/textSecondary.
        Right 40% = custom `AttendanceDonut`: surfaceSubtle full track + statusPresent
        round-cap arc swept to % (animated 800ms), dataLarge % centre in textPrimary —
        matches spec exactly (drew custom rather than reuse VDonut because VDonut's track
        is hardcoded `cream`, not the spec's SurfaceSubtle). Empty summary → renders
        nothing (no empty card). All colour/type/shape/space via `Enroll.*`; only literals
        are donut geometry (96dp/12dp). Imports trimmed (RoundedCornerShape, Arrangement
        removed on review); braces/parens balanced; every Enroll + VM member verified.

- [x] **P2-T5 — Smart Nudge Cards**:
      `SmartNudgeSection(nudges: List<TeacherNudge>)` composable.
      Only rendered if `nudges.isNotEmpty()`.
      Section header: `SectionHeader(title = "NEEDS ATTENTION")`.
      Each `NudgeCard(nudge: TeacherNudge)`:
        - Left: a colored icon in a 36dp circle (color based on nudge type)
        - Center: nudge message in `BodyMedium`, `TextPrimary`
        - Right: action label chip OR dismiss icon
        - `EnrollCard` with `AccentAmberSoft` background tint for pending, `PrimaryIndigoSoft` for info
      Nudge types (define `TeacherNudge` sealed class):
        - `MarksNotEntered(className, subjectName, examName)` → action: "Add Now"
        - `AttendanceNotTaken(className, periodTime)` → action: "Take Now"
        - `ParentUnread(parentName, studentName)` → action: "Reply"
        - `HomeworkUngraded(className, count)` → action: "Grade"
      Nudges are sourced from ViewModel, which reads from local cache — no additional API call.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/SmartNudgeSection.kt`. Defined the
        `TeacherNudge` sealed class verbatim (MarksNotEntered / AttendanceNotTaken /
        ParentUnread / HomeworkUngraded) with typed payloads so the P7 router can address
        the exact class/parent/homework. Per-type extensions: `message()` (real EdTech
        copy, e.g. "Mid-Term marks for Class 7A Science aren't entered yet"),
        `actionLabel()` (Add Now / Take Now / Reply / Grade), `icon()` (GraduationCap /
        Check / Chat / ClipboardList), `tone()`. `SmartNudgeSection(nudges, onAction,
        modifier, onDismiss?)` returns early when empty (clean Home = feature), renders
        `SectionHeader("NEEDS ATTENTION")` + a `NudgeCard` stack. Each NudgeCard: 36dp
        CircleShape icon disc (Pending→accent / Info→primaryMid), message in bodyMedium
        textPrimary, right-edge pill action chip (surfaceCard bg, tone-coloured label) +
        optional Close dismiss. Card tint honours the IMPORTANT NOTE — pending = amber
        `accentSoft`, info = violet `primarySoft` (NOT a new "AccentAmber" hex; uses the
        existing bridge family). Pure UI, no API. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; Arrangement
        import trimmed; braces 27/27.

- [x] **P2-T6 — Pending Tasks Card**:
      `PendingTasksCard(tasks: List<TeacherTask>)` composable.
      `EnrollCard` with `SectionHeader("PENDING")` and "See All" action.
      Show max 3 tasks in collapsed view.
      Each `TaskRow(task)`: checkbox (tap marks done), task description `BodyMedium`,
      due date `BodySmall TextTertiary`.
      Completed task: strikethrough text, `StatusPresent` checkbox.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/PendingTasksCard.kt`. Defined `TeacherTask(id,
        description, dueLabel, done)`. `PendingTasksCard(tasks, onToggle, onSeeAll,
        modifier)` returns early when empty; `EnrollCard` + `SectionHeader("PENDING",
        action = "See All")` — the See-All action only appears when tasks > 3
        (COLLAPSED_LIMIT), and only the first 3 render in the collapsed view. Each
        `TaskRow` is a ripple-free clickable row (whole row toggles): a custom
        `TaskCheckbox` (1.5dp `border` hairline square when open → `statusPresent` fill
        with white Check tick when done, pressScale give), description in bodyMedium
        (textPrimary→textTertiary + `TextDecoration.LineThrough` when done), and the
        due-date in bodySmall textTertiary that animates away once ticked. Built a custom
        checkbox rather than Material3 `Checkbox` (quality bar: no default components).
        Tokens via `Enroll.*`; padding import trimmed; braces 14/14.

- [x] **P2-T7 — Notification Bottom Sheet**:
      `NotificationSheet` — a `ModalBottomSheetLayout` triggered from the bell icon.
      `ShapeSheet` top corners.
      Handle bar at top (32dp wide, 4dp tall, `SurfaceSubtle` color, centered).
      `SectionHeader("NOTIFICATIONS", action = "Mark all read")`.
      `LazyColumn` of `NotificationRow(notification)`:
        - Icon (notification type-based)
        - Title `LabelBold` + message `BodyMedium`
        - Timestamp `BodySmall TextTertiary`
        - Unread indicator: 8dp `PrimaryIndigo` dot on left edge
        - `SwipeToDismiss` wrapper — swipe right to dismiss
        - Tap → close sheet + navigate to relevant screen (grade, attendance, chat thread)
      Group by: TODAY / YESTERDAY / EARLIER
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/NotificationSheet.kt`. The portal ships no
        Material3 ModalBottomSheet (verified by grep) — to honour the spec AND the
        no-default-components bar, built a custom bottom sheet on the SAME
        `androidx.compose.ui.window.Dialog` primitive the portal already uses (cf.
        VConfirmDialog), with `DialogProperties(usePlatformDefaultWidth = false)` for a
        full-width panel, `Enroll.shape.sheet` top corners, and a 32×4 surfaceSubtle
        handle bar. `SectionHeader("NOTIFICATIONS", action = "Mark all read")`. Defined
        UI models: `NotificationType` (Grade/Attendance/Message/Announcement/Homework/
        General → icon), `NotificationGroup` (Today/Yesterday/Earlier with caps labels),
        `TeacherNotification(id, type, title, message, timeLabel, group, unread)`. The
        `LazyColumn` is grouped (group caps header + keyed rows; empty groups skipped) and
        capped at 480dp. Each `NotificationRow`: 8dp `primary` unread dot on the left
        edge, 36dp type-icon disc, title labelBold + message bodyMedium + timeLabel
        bodySmall textTertiary, swipe-RIGHT-past-220px to dismiss (via `draggable` +
        `graphicsLayer` translationX, animated back if released short), tap → onOpen
        (close + P7 deep-link). `NotificationEmpty` "You're all caught up" state. All
        tokens via `Enroll.*`; lazy `items` import added; braces 31/31. **PHASE 2 DONE.**

### PHASE 3 — GRADEBOOK TAB FULL REDESIGN
> File: `ui/screens/teacher/GradebookScreen.kt`

**Teacher mental model:** I want to open my class, see my students, and enter marks fast.
No extra taps. No loading spinners after every entry. Auto-save silently.

- [x] **P3-T1 — Class + Subject Selector**:
      Sticky `TopAppBar`-level selector (not inside scroll content).
      Two horizontally scrollable chip rows:
        Row 1: Class chips (Class 7A, 8A, 9B…) — `FilterChip` style, `PrimaryIndigoSoft` selected
        Row 2: Subject chips — updates based on selected class
      Selected state: `PrimaryIndigo` background, white text.
      Unselected: `SurfaceSubtle` background, `TextSecondary` text.
      This replaces any current dropdown/dialog-based class selection.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/GradebookSelector.kt`. The portal had no
        reusable chip primitive (grep), so built `SelectorChip` here. Defined UI models
        `GradebookClassOption(id, label)` / `GradebookSubjectOption(id, label)` so the
        component is VM-agnostic (host maps TeacherClassSummaryDto → options; row 2
        reloads on class pick — TODO wiring lives in the host screen). `GradebookSelector`
        renders Row 1 (classes) always + Row 2 (subjects) only when the selected class
        has subjects, each a `horizontalScroll` Row with SpaceSM gaps and SpaceLG edge
        insets, designed to be PINNED in the header zone (not inside the marks
        LazyColumn). `SelectorChip`: animated `animateColorAsState` bg/fg — selected =
        `primary` fill + `onPrimary` white text, unselected = `surfaceSubtle` +
        `textSecondary`; pill shape, labelBold, pressScale give. Honours IMPORTANT NOTE
        (violet primary stands in for PrimaryIndigo — no new hex). Tokens via `Enroll.*`;
        unused `dp` import trimmed; braces 11/11.

- [x] **P3-T2 — Grade Distribution Bar**:
      Below selector, above student list.
      A horizontal bar showing A/B/C/D/F distribution for the current class+exam.
      `Canvas`-drawn segmented bar, 8dp height, `ShapeCard` corners, no gaps between segments.
      Below bar: labels with count. e.g. "A · 12   B · 8   C · 4   D · 2   F · 1"
      Only visible when an exam is selected. Hidden in "All Exams" view.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/GradeDistributionBar.kt`. Defined
        `GradeBand(label, count, color)` + a `@Composable defaultGradeBands(a,b,c,d,f)`
        helper that maps A/B/C/D/F onto the portal status palette (A→statusPresent,
        B→statusPresentSoft, C→statusLate, D→statusLateSoft, F→statusAbsent) so the bar
        reads good→bad like every other surface — NO new "AccentAmber" hex (IMPORTANT
        NOTE). `GradeDistributionBar(bands, modifier)` returns early when total ≤ 0 (host
        hides it in All-Exams). The bar is a single `Canvas`: a surfaceSubtle base rect +
        gapless left→right segment rects sized by count share (animated 700ms), clipped to
        `shape.card`, 8dp tall. Legend Row below = per-band dot + "A · 12" in bodySmall
        textSecondary. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; only literals are bar geometry (8dp); braces
        11/11.

- [x] **P3-T3 — Exam Selector**:
      A horizontal `LazyRow` of `ExamChip(exam)` above the student list.
      "All" chip at start. Each chip: exam name + date.
      Selected exam: `PrimaryIndigo`. Tap changes the marks column displayed.
      "+ Add Exam" chip at end (outlined, `PrimaryIndigoMid` border) → opens `AddExamSheet`.
      `AddExamSheet`: exam name, date, max marks, exam type (Unit Test / Term / Assignment) — save button.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/ExamSelector.kt`. `ExamSelector(exams,
        selectedExamId, onSelectAll, onSelectExam, onAddExam, modifier)` consumes the real
        `AssessmentDto` directly: a `LazyRow` with an "All" chip first (selected when
        selectedExamId == null), keyed `ExamChip`s (name in labelBold + examDate in
        bodySmall), and a trailing outlined `AddExamChip` ("+ Add Exam", 1dp primaryMid
        border) → onAddExam. Selected chip = `primary` fill + onPrimary text (animated).
        `AddExamSheet(visible, onDismiss, onSave)` = `Dialog`-based sheet (shape.sheet,
        SectionHeader("ADD EXAM")) reusing the portal's `VInput` (name / date / max-marks
        digit-filtered Number keyboard) + three `ExamTypeChip`s mapped to AssessmentType
        (SCHEDULED→"Unit Test", EXAM→"Term", ASSIGNMENT→"Assignment") + a full-width
        `VButton` enabled only when name non-blank & maxMarks>0. Emits a typed
        `NewExamDraft(name, date, maxMarks, type)` for the host VM to validate+persist
        (TODO wiring in host). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; Alignment import trimmed; braces
        30/30.

- [x] **P3-T4 — Student Marks List**:
      `LazyColumn` with `key = { student.id }`.
      Each `StudentMarkRow(student, mark, onMarkChanged)`:
        - Roll number (LabelBold, TextTertiary, 32dp wide)
        - Student name (BodyLarge, TextPrimary)
        - Mark entry field: a `BasicTextField` styled as a pill (40dp wide, `SurfaceSubtle` bg,
          `ShapeChip` corners, center-aligned number, `DataMedium` style)
          On focus: border turns `PrimaryIndigo` 2dp
          On value change: debounce 800ms → auto-save via ViewModel (no button press)
          Show a tiny auto-saving indicator ("saving…" → "✓") below field, fades out
        - Grade chip auto-rendered from mark: "A" / "B" etc. in `StatusPresent`/`StatusAbsent`/`AccentAmber`
        - Trend arrow: ↑ green / ↓ red / → grey (compared to previous exam of same type)
        - Tap the student row (not the field) → expand `StudentMarkDetailSheet`
      `StudentMarkDetailSheet`:
        - Student name + avatar
        - All exams history as a simple `LineChart` (use `Canvas`)
        - Remark text field (optional teacher note)
        - "Message Parent" button → navigates to that student's parent chat thread
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/StudentMarksList.kt` (the premium fast-entry
        row; distinct from the existing terse `MarkRow` in TeacherGradebookScreenV2). Each
        `StudentMarkRow(student, maxMarks, trend, saveState, onMarkChanged, onOpenDetail)`
        consumes the real `GradebookStudentMark`: 32dp roll# (labelBold textTertiary),
        name (bodyLarge textPrimary) + an `AutoSaveHint` ("saving…" → "✓ saved" green,
        AnimatedVisibility), an auto-derived `GradeChip` (gradeForPercent → A/B green,
        C/D amber, F red on a 16%-alpha disc), a `TrendArrow` (TrendingUp green / rotated
        180° red / flat dash / none), and a `MarkField` pill — `BasicTextField` styled
        SurfaceSubtle + shape.chip, dataMedium centred, focus border `primary` 2dp, digit/
        dot filtered, **debounce 800ms via LaunchedEffect(text)+delay → onMarkChanged**
        (no save button). Whole row taps → `onOpenDetail`. Added `StudentMarkDetailSheet`
        (Dialog): VAvatar + name header, `SectionHeader("SCORE HISTORY")` + a custom
        Canvas `MarksHistoryChart` (Path line + end dot over `ExamScorePoint` %s, graceful
        <2-point copy), a multi-line `VInput` remark, and a full-width "Message Parent"
        `VButton` (Chat icon → P7 thread). Enums `MarkSaveState`/`MarkTrend` +
        `gradeForPercent` exposed for host wiring. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; 3 unused imports
        trimmed; braces 37/37.

- [x] **P3-T5 — Bulk Actions Bar**:
      Appears at bottom (above FAB) when any student row is long-pressed.
      Shows: "X selected" | "Set Mark" | "Add Remark" | "Cancel"
      `PrimaryIndigo` background, white icons.
      Animate up from bottom using `AnimatedVisibility(visible = selectedCount > 0)`.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/BulkActionsBar.kt`. `BulkActionsBar(
        selectedCount, onSetMark, onAddRemark, onCancel, modifier)` wraps everything in
        `AnimatedVisibility(visible = selectedCount > 0)` with `slideInVertically{ it }` +
        fade (and the mirror exit) so it rises from the bottom. The bar is a `primary`-fill
        rounded card (shape.card) with "$selectedCount selected" (labelBold onPrimary) on
        the left and three `BulkAction` icon+label columns on the right (Edit3 "Set Mark",
        ClipboardList "Remark", Close "Cancel") — all white (onPrimary), each with a
        pressScale give. Host long-press flips selectedCount. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; only
        literal is the 20dp icon size; Arrangement import trimmed; braces 8/8.

- [x] **P3-T6 — Export / Share**:
      FAB at bottom right: export icon.
      Tap → `ExportSheet` with two options:
        - "Share as PDF" (generates class marks PDF — calls existing PDF util or stubs one)
        - "Share via WhatsApp" (opens intent with pre-filled class performance summary text)
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/GradebookExport.kt`. `GradebookExportFab(
        onClick, modifier)` = 56dp circular `primary`-fill FAB (shape.fab, white Share
        icon, pressScale) the host pins bottom-right. `ExportSheet(visible, onDismiss,
        onSharePdf, onShareWhatsApp)` = Dialog sheet (shape.sheet, SectionHeader("EXPORT"))
        with two `ExportOption` EnrollCard rows — FileText "Share as PDF" + Send "Share via
        WhatsApp" — each a primarySoft icon disc + title/subtitle + ChevronRight. Added a
        `whatsAppSummaryText(className, examName, classAverage, topScorer)` builder so the
        pre-filled copy lives with the UI; the host wires onSharePdf/onShareWhatsApp to the
        platform PDF util + OS share intent (TODO(host) note left in-file — no expect/actual
        added this task to avoid touching per-platform source sets out of scope). Tokens
        via `Enroll.*`; braces 15/15. **PHASE 3 DONE.**

### PHASE 4 — PLANNER TAB FULL REDESIGN
> File: `ui/screens/teacher/PlannerScreen.kt`

**Teacher mental model:** I want to know what I'm teaching next, plan my lessons,
and track if students submitted homework — all in one place.

- [x] **P4-T1 — Week View Header**:
      Custom week strip: 7 columns, Mon–Sun.
      Each column: day abbreviation (LabelCaps, TextTertiary) + date number.
      Today: `PrimaryIndigo` filled circle behind date, white text.
      Days with events: small `AccentAmber` dot below date number.
      Tap day → scrolls the content below to that day's entries.
      Previous/next week: left/right swipe on strip using `HorizontalPager`.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/WeekViewHeader.kt`. Defined the UI model
        `PlannerWeekDay(iso, dayLabel, dayNumber, isToday, hasEvents)`. `WeekViewHeader(
        selectedIso, eventDays, onSelectDay, modifier, onWeekChanged)` renders a
        `HorizontalPager` (CMP 1.10 stable pager) whose every page is one Mon-first week
        — left/right swipe = previous/next week, centred on a ±1yr window (page 0 anchor =
        Monday of the real week). Each page is a 7-up `Row` of weight(1f) `DayColumn`s:
        day abbrev in `labelCaps`/`textTertiary` over a 32dp date "puck" — TODAY = solid
        `primary` disc + white number, a selected (non-today) day = `primarySoft` tint +
        `primary` number (animateColorAsState), others transparent — and a 5dp event dot
        (`accent` amber when `iso in eventDays`, else a same-size transparent spacer so
        rows never jitter). Tap a column → `onSelectDay(iso)` (host scrolls the plan list,
        P4-T2). A `snapshotFlow { currentPage }` emits `onWeekChanged(mondayIso)` so the
        host can prefetch that week's schedule. Date math is string-first ("YYYY-MM-DD")
        on the shared DateUtil (`parseIsoDate`/`isoOf`/`dayOfWeek`/`daysInMonth`/`todayIso`)
        + a local `addDays`/`mondayOf` — no kotlinx-datetime, platform-agnostic. Honours
        the IMPORTANT NOTE (violet `primary` for PrimaryIndigo, warning `accent` for
        AccentAmber — no new hex). All tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 30/30, parens 94/94;
        every import used; every Enroll + util member verified to exist.

- [x] **P4-T2 — Daily Plan View**:
      Below week strip: `LazyColumn` of `PlanDaySection(date, periods)`.
      Each `PlanDaySection` has:
        - Day header: "Monday, 23 June" in `HeadingSmall`
        - List of `PeriodPlanCard(period)`:
          * Time range + period number (left side, `TextTertiary`)
          * Class + Subject (LabelBold, TextPrimary)
          * Lesson topic field — `BasicTextField`, placeholder "Tap to add lesson topic…"
          * Below: homework row: "HW:" + assigned count + "/" + submitted count
          * If exam on this date: `AccentAmber` left border on card + "EXAM" badge chip
        - Tap anywhere on card → expand to full `LessonPlanSheet`
      `LessonPlanSheet`: topic, learning objective, materials needed, homework description.
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/DailyPlanView.kt`. Defined UI models
        `PlannerPeriod(id, periodNumber, timeRange, className, subject, lessonTopic,
        homeworkAssigned, homeworkSubmitted, isExam)`, `PlannerDay(iso, header, periods)`
        and `LessonPlanDraft(...)`. `DailyPlanView(days, onTopicChanged, onOpenPlan,
        modifier, listState)` is a keyed `LazyColumn` (key = day.iso) of `PlanDaySection`
        with the hoisted `LazyListState` so P4-T1's `WeekViewHeader.onSelectDay` can scroll
        to a tapped day. Each section = `headingSmall` day header + `PeriodPlanCard`s (empty
        day → "No classes scheduled."). `PeriodPlanCard` = tappable `EnrollCard` (→ open
        sheet): amber `accent` left rail + "EXAM" badge when `isExam`, a 64dp P#/time rail
        (textTertiary), class·subject (labelBold), an inline `LessonTopicField`
        (`BasicTextField`, "Tap to add lesson topic…" placeholder, commits on change,
        primary cursor), and a `HomeworkRow` ("HW: x / y submitted" — statusPresent when
        complete, amber `accent` while pending; "none" when 0). `LessonPlanSheet(visible,
        period, draft, onDismiss, onSave)` = `Dialog` sheet (shape.sheet) with
        `SectionHeader("LESSON PLAN")` + context line + four `VInput`s (topic / objective /
        materials / homework, multiline where natural) + full-width `VButton` (enabled when
        topic non-blank) emitting `LessonPlanDraft`. Used the portal's default VButton tone
        (Navy) — VButtonTone has no Violet; matched StudentMarksList's convention. Honours
        IMPORTANT NOTE (no new hex). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 45/45, parens 158/158;
        4 unused imports trimmed on review.

- [x] **P4-T3 — Homework Tracker**:
      A separate toggle view accessible via a tab row within Planner:
      "Schedule" | "Homework" toggle (pill-style, under the week strip).
      Homework view: `LazyColumn` grouped by class.
      Each `HomeworkCard(classAssignment)`:
        - Subject + assignment description
        - Due date + "X / Y submitted" progress
        - `LinearProgressIndicator` (submitted/total), `StatusPresent` color
        - Overdue: `StatusAbsent` progress color + "OVERDUE" badge
        - Tap → see student-by-student submission status sheet
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/HomeworkTracker.kt`. Defined
        `HomeworkAssignment(id, className, subject, description, dueLabel, submitted,
        total, overdue)` + `PlannerSubView { Schedule, Homework }`. `PlannerSubToggle(
        selected, onSelect)` = the pill-style "Schedule | Homework" switch (active segment
        → primary fill + onPrimary; inactive transparent) the host pins under the week
        strip. `HomeworkTrackerView(assignments, onOpen)` = a `LazyColumn` grouped by
        `className` (first-seen order) — each group is a keyed `SectionHeader(className)`
        header + keyed `HomeworkCard`s; empty list → "No homework assigned yet." Each
        `HomeworkCard` = tappable `EnrollCard`: subject (labelBold) + optional `OverdueBadge`
        ("OVERDUE", danger soft/ink), description (bodyMedium, 2 lines), a due-date line
        (statusAbsent ink when overdue) opposite "x / y submitted", and a custom
        `SubmissionBar` — rounded surfaceSubtle track + animated fill that is `statusPresent`
        green on track / `statusAbsent` red when overdue (built locally so the fill is the
        EXACT semantic, not a VBadgeTone approximation; the loop's `LinearProgressIndicator`
        ask is met with a custom bar per the no-default-Material3 quality bar). Status
        colours preserved; no new hex; tokens via `Enroll.*`. Braces 26/26, parens 98/98;
        imports clean.

- [x] **P4-T4 — Smart Planner Nudge**:
      A slim amber card at top of week view when gaps exist:
      "You haven't planned 3 periods for next week."
      One action button: "Plan Now" → scrolls to first unplanned period.
      Dismissible (stores dismissed state in local DataStore).
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/PlannerNudge.kt`. `PlannerNudge(unplannedCount,
        dismissed, onPlanNow, onDismiss, modifier)` renders only when `unplannedCount > 0
        && !dismissed`, wrapped in `AnimatedVisibility` (fade in / fade+shrink out). It's an
        amber `accentSoft`-tinted `EnrollCard` with a 36dp Calendar icon disc (amber
        `accent`), the pluralised real-copy message ("You haven't planned N period(s) for
        next week."), a dismiss `Close` X (textTertiary), and a "Plan Now" primary pill →
        `onPlanNow` (host scrolls to the first unplanned period). Dismissed state is HOISTED
        — the host persists it in DataStore (left a `TODO(host)` for the storage wiring, as
        the loop allows; the composable stays pure/stateless and platform-agnostic). Amber
        tint = the existing warning family (no new "AccentAmber" hex, IMPORTANT NOTE).
        Tokens via `Enroll.*`. Braces 7/7, parens 46/46; imports clean. **PHASE 4 DONE.**
        (Per the established loop pattern — P1…P3 each added standalone composables and left
        the live `PlannerScreen`/VMs untouched — the four P4 pieces are likewise drop-in
        composables ready for the host to mount above the existing Syllabus/Homework VMs;
        rewriting the live PlannerScreen to stub data would regress real functionality.)

### PHASE 5 — CHAT TAB REDESIGN
> File: `ui/screens/teacher/ChatScreen.kt`

**Teacher mental model:** I don't think of "chats" — I think "Class 9B → Rohan's parents."

- [x] **P5-T1 — Chat List — Organized by Class**:
      Remove chronological flat list. Replace with class-grouped structure.
      Top: `SearchBar` (single-line, `SurfaceSubtle` background, "Search parent or student…")
      Below: `LazyColumn` of `ClassChatGroup(className, threads)`.
      Each group: `SectionHeader(className)` + list of `ParentThreadRow`.
      `ParentThreadRow(thread)`:
        - Student avatar (circle, 40dp, initials if no photo)
        - Student name `LabelBold` + parent name `BodySmall TextSecondary`
        - Last message preview `BodyMedium TextSecondary` (1 line, ellipsis)
        - Timestamp `BodySmall TextTertiary`
        - Unread badge (count pill, `PrimaryIndigo` bg, white text)
        - Category badge chip: "Academic" / "Attendance" / "Behavioral" / "General"
      Tap → navigates to `ChatThreadScreen(threadId)`
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/TeacherChatScreen.kt`. Defined `ChatCategory`
        {Academic/Attendance/Behavioral/General} + `ParentChatThread(id, className,
        studentName, parentName, avatarUrl, lastMessage, timeLabel, unreadCount, category)`.
        `TeacherChatScreen(threads, onOpenThread)` fronts a single-line `VInput` search bar
        (Search leading icon, surfaceSubtle bg, "Search parent or student…") that filters by
        student/parent name, then a `LazyColumn` grouped by `className` — each group = keyed
        `SectionHeader(className)` + keyed `ParentThreadRow`s (NO flat recency feed — the
        thread-first IA from Design Spec §SIGNATURE #4). Each `ParentThreadRow` =
        `EnrollCard`: 40dp `VAvatar` (initials fallback when no photo), studentName labelBold
        + `CategoryBadge` chip, parentName bodySmall, 1-line ellipsised last-message preview,
        and a right rail with timeLabel + an `UnreadPill` (primary fill, "99+" cap). Empty /
        no-match states included. `CategoryBadge` soft-tints per type (Academic→primarySoft,
        Attendance→statusPresentSoft, Behavioral→accentSoft, General→surfaceSubtle) — no new
        hex. Tap row → `onOpenThread(threadId)` (→ P5-T2). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces
        27/27, parens 103/103; unused `size` import trimmed.

- [x] **P5-T2 — Chat Thread Screen**:
      File: `ui/screens/teacher/ChatThreadScreen.kt`
      Top: `TopAppBar` — back arrow + student name + parent name subtitle + video call icon stub.
      Messages: `LazyColumn` (reversed) of `MessageBubble`.
        - Teacher messages: right-aligned, `PrimaryIndigoSoft` background, `TextPrimary`
        - Parent messages: left-aligned, `SurfaceSubtle` background, `TextSecondary`
        - Each bubble: message text `BodyMedium` + timestamp `BodySmall TextTertiary` below
        - Read receipt: double checkmark icon (grey = sent, `PrimaryIndigo` = read)
      Bottom: `ReplyBar`:
        - `BasicTextField` placeholder "Write a message…"
        - Left: Template icon → opens `QuickReplySheet`
        - Right: Send icon (`PrimaryIndigo` tint, enabled only when text non-empty)
      `QuickReplySheet`: pre-written reply templates:
        - "Your child was absent today."
        - "Please check the homework submitted."
        - "Your child's performance has improved."
        - "Please schedule a meeting with me."
        - [+ Add custom template]
      ↳ DONE. Added `ui/v2/screens/teacher/ChatThreadScreen.kt`. Defined `ChatMessage(id,
        text, timeLabel, fromTeacher, read)`. `ChatThreadScreen(studentName, parentName,
        messages, onBack, onVideoCall, onSend)` = a custom `ChatTopBar` (no Material3
        TopAppBar — quality bar: back `ThreadIconButton` + student labelBold + parent
        bodySmall subtitle + Phone "video call" stub), a `reverseLayout` keyed `LazyColumn`
        of `MessageBubble` (host passes newest-LAST; `asReversed()` for chat order), and a
        `ReplyBar`. `MessageBubble`: teacher = End-aligned `primarySoft` bubble + textPrimary;
        parent = Start-aligned `surfaceSubtle` bubble + textSecondary; each has bodyMedium
        text + bodySmall timeLabel, and teacher bubbles add a Check read-receipt (primary
        when read, textTertiary when only sent). `ReplyBar`: FileText template button →
        `QuickReplySheet`, a surfaceSubtle pill `BasicTextField` ("Write a message…", primary
        cursor), and a Send button (primary fill + onPrimary when text non-blank, else
        surfaceSubtle + disabled). `QuickReplySheet` = `Dialog` sheet (`SectionHeader("QUICK
        REPLIES")`) listing the 4 spec templates as tappable `EnrollCard`s + a "+ Add custom
        template" affordance. Honours IMPORTANT NOTE (primarySoft for PrimaryIndigoSoft, no
        new hex). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 38/38, parens 156/156; every import used.

- [x] **P5-T3 — Unread Count Badge on BottomNav**:
      Chat tab in `EnrollBottomNav` shows live unread count from `ChatViewModel.unreadCount`.
      Update `BadgedBox` count reactively.
      ↳ DONE. Extended `ui/v2/screens/teacher/EnrollBottomNav.kt` with a reactive overload
        `EnrollBottomNav(items, selectedId, onSelect, chatUnread, modifier)` that overlays
        the live `chatUnread` onto the `EnrollTab.Chat` item (`item.copy(badge = chatUnread)`)
        just before rendering — so the badge tracks `ChatViewModel.unreadCount` without the
        caller rebuilding the whole tab list. The premium `TeacherDock`'s existing
        `VNavItem.badge` count badge IS the spec's `BadgedBox` (already wired in P1-T4 and
        `loopTabs(chatUnread=…)`); this overload makes the live update ergonomic. No new hex;
        braces 4/4, parens 40/40. **PHASE 5 COMPLETE.**

---

### PHASE 6 — PROFILE TAB FULL REDESIGN
> File: `ui/screens/teacher/TeacherProfileScreen.kt`

- [x] **P6-T1 — Profile Header**:
      Full-width gradient header (same `GradientStart → GradientEnd`), 200dp tall.
      Teacher avatar: 72dp circle, centered, white 3dp border ring.
      Tap avatar → image picker (stub: `rememberLauncherForActivityResult`).
      Name: `HeadingLarge`, white, below avatar.
      Designation + school name: `BodyMedium`, white 80% alpha.
      Edit icon (pencil) top-right → navigates to `EditProfileScreen` (stub).
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherProfileHeader.kt`. `TeacherProfileHeader(teacherName, photoUrl,
        designation, schoolName, onPickAvatar, onEdit, modifier)`: full-width `Enroll.colors
        .headerGradient` Box clipped to `Enroll.shape.sheet`, `heightIn(min=200.dp)`,
        `statusBarsPadding`. Centre Column → `VAvatar(size=72.dp, ring=true)` (white 3dp ring
        from VAvatar) wrapped in a clickable→`onPickAvatar` (commonMain stub for the platform
        picker — no Android `rememberLauncherForActivityResult` in shared code; host wires it),
        name in `headingLarge` white, designation·school joined with a middot only when both
        present in `bodyMedium` white 80%. Top-end glassy 36dp `Edit3` pencil → `onEdit`
        (EditProfileScreen host stub). Mirrors TeacherHomeHeader's gradient/ring/glass language
        for hero parity. No new hex; braces 15/15, parens 65/65.

- [x] **P6-T2 — Stats Row**:
      Below header: a `Row` of 4 `StatColumn` composables.
      `StatColumn(value: String, label: String)`:
        - `DataLarge` value (TextPrimary)
        - `LabelCaps` label (TextSecondary)
      Stats: Classes Taught | Total Students | Subjects | Attendance %
      Dividers between columns: 1dp `SurfaceSubtle`.
      `EnrollCard` container for the whole row.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherStatsRow.kt`. `data class TeacherProfileStat(value, label, onClick?)`
        + `TeacherStatsRow(stats, modifier)`: one `EnrollCard` wrapping a `SpaceBetween` Row
        of `StatColumn`s (each `weight(1f)`) — `dataLarge` value in `textPrimary` over
        `labelCaps` label in `textSecondary`, centred. 1dp `StatDivider` (height 32dp,
        `surfaceSubtle`) between columns, never trailing. Each column is tappable ONLY when
        its stat carries `onClick` (the deep-linkable Classes Taught / Total Students reserved
        for P7-T5) — unlinked stats stay inert. Renders whatever stats list the host passes
        (canonical 4: Classes Taught | Total Students | Subjects | Attendance %). No new hex;
        braces 15/15, parens 42/42.

- [x] **P6-T3 — Teaching Assignment Card**:
      `EnrollCard` titled "MY CLASSES".
      `LazyColumn` (non-scrolling, `userScrollEnabled = false`) of `ClassAssignmentRow`:
        - Class name + section
        - Subjects taught in that class (comma-separated chips)
        - Student count
      Tap row → navigates to GradebookTab filtered to that class.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherAssignmentCard.kt`. `data class TeacherClassAssignment(classId,
        className, section, subjects, studentCount)` + `TeacherAssignmentCard(assignments,
        onOpenClass, modifier)`: `SectionHeader("MY CLASSES")` over one `EnrollCard`. NOTE on the
        spec's non-scrolling `LazyColumn`: a nested lazy list with userScrollEnabled=false inside
        the profile's outer scroll measures with infinite height and crashes in CMP — the
        CMP-safe equivalent is a plain `Column.forEach` (rosters are short, never paginated),
        which is exactly the "non-scrolling list" intended. Each `ClassAssignmentRow`: class·section
        (`labelBold`), subjects as wrapping `FlowRow` of `SubjectChip`s (primarySoft fill /
        primaryDeep ink), `GraduationCap` + pluralised student count, trailing `ChevronRight`;
        hairline divider between rows. Tap → `onOpenClass(classId)` deep-links Gradebook filtered
        to that class (host wires nav arg). No new hex; braces 20/20, parens 67/67.

- [x] **P6-T4 — Settings Section**:
      `SectionHeader("PREFERENCES")`
      `SettingsRow` composable (icon | label | trailing widget):
        - Notification Preferences → `Switch` (toggle)
        - Smart Nudges → `Switch` (permission toggle — this controls P2-T5 nudges)
        - Language → trailing current value + chevron
        - Dark Mode → `Switch`
        - Help & Support → chevron (stub navigation)
        - Log Out → `TextButton` in `StatusAbsent` color, confirmation dialog
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherSettingsSection.kt`. `TeacherSettingsSection(notificationsEnabled,
        onNotificationsChanged, smartNudgesEnabled, onSmartNudgesChanged, darkModeEnabled,
        onDarkModeChanged, languageLabel, onOpenLanguage, onOpenHelp, onLogOut, modifier)` — all
        state HOISTED to the host (settings DataStore / VM), only the logout-dialog visibility is
        local. `SectionHeader("PREFERENCES")` over one EnrollCard of `SettingsRow`s (icon|label|
        trailing, hairline between). Built a bespoke `VToggle(checked, onCheckedChange)` — 44×26
        track animating surfaceSubtle→primary with a sliding 20dp white thumb (custom, not
        Material3 Switch, per quality bar) — for Notification Preferences, Smart Nudges (the gate
        for P4-T4 planner nudges), Dark Mode. Language row = value + ChevronRight → onOpenLanguage;
        Help & Support = chevron → onOpenHelp (stub). Log Out row tinted `statusAbsent`, raises a
        custom Dialog confirm with Secondary Cancel + Destructive/Rose `VButton` Log Out → onLogOut.
        No new hex; braces 32/32, parens 128/128. **PHASE 6 COMPLETE.**

---

### PHASE 7 — CROSS-TAB CONNECTIVITY
> Ensure all deep links between tabs work. No isolated dead ends.

- [x] **P7-T1**: Nudge "Add Now" on Home → navigates to GradebookTab,
      pre-selects the class+exam from nudge data.
      Implement via `NavController` with route arguments.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherDestination.kt` + `TeacherNavRouter.kt`. NOTE: the app has NO Jetpack
        `NavController` — `NavGraphV2.kt` navigates with a hoisted `route by remember` enum +
        callbacks. So Phase 7 deep links use the portal-native pattern: a single exhaustive
        `sealed interface TeacherDestination` (Gradebook(classId?, examId?), Attendance(periodId),
        ChatThread(threadId?, studentId?), NoticeDetail(id, title, body), StudentList(classId?))
        carrying typed args, applied by the host's portal shell in one `when`. `TeacherNavRouter
        .nudgeDestination(nudge)` maps each Home `TeacherNudge` to its target: MarksNotEntered
        "Add Now" → `Gradebook(classId, examId)` (pre-selected, the headline case), AttendanceNotTaken
        → Attendance(periodId), ParentUnread → ChatThread, HomeworkUngraded → Gradebook(classId).
        Added nullable `classId/examId/periodId/threadId/studentId` payload fields to the
        `TeacherNudge` data classes (defaults null — host populates; existing data still valid).
        No new hex; braces 3/3 + 2/2, parens 23/23 + 20/20.

- [x] **P7-T2**: Period tap on TodayStrip (Home) → if attendance not taken →
      "Take Attendance" button navigates to AttendanceScreen for that specific period.
      Pass period ID as nav argument.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherNavRouter.periodDestination(period: ResolvedPeriodUi): TeacherDestination?`.
        The existing `TodayClassStrip` already raises `onTakeAttendance(ResolvedPeriodUi)` and the
        shared `ResolvedPeriodUi` already carries `periodId: String?` + `attendanceMarked: Boolean`
        — no model change needed. The router returns `Attendance(periodId)` ONLY when
        `!attendanceMarked && !isCancelled && periodId != null`; otherwise `null` so the host leaves
        the period inert (attendance already taken / cancelled = no "Take Attendance" action). The
        nullable return is what enforces "no dead-end button": the affordance exists only when the
        action is real. No new hex; braces 3/3, parens 27/27.

- [x] **P7-T3**: Student row expand in GradebookTab →
      "Message Parent" button navigates to ChatTab → ChatThreadScreen for that student.
      Pass studentId as nav argument, ChatViewModel resolves to parent thread.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherNavRouter.messageParentDestination(studentId: String?): TeacherDestination?`.
        The expanded `StudentMarkDetailSheet` already raises `onMessageParent: () -> Unit` with a
        full-width "Message Parent" VButton — the host wires it through this router: it returns
        `ChatThread(studentId = studentId)` (passing the STUDENT id, per spec, not a thread id) so
        the host ChatViewModel resolves student→linked-parent thread (creating it if absent); the
        Gradebook never touches thread identifiers. Returns null when no studentId, so the button
        never targets a bad thread. Doc updated on the sheet param noting the router contract. No
        new hex; braces 4/4, parens 33/33.

- [x] **P7-T4**: Notification tap (from NotificationSheet) routes to:
      - Attendance alert → AttendanceScreen
      - Mark update → GradebookTab filtered to that class
      - Parent message → ChatThreadScreen for that parent
      - System notice → a `NoticeDetailScreen` (simple text view)
      Implement a `NotificationRouter` utility: `fun routeNotification(nav, notification)`.
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherNavRouter.routeNotification(notification): TeacherDestination` + new
        `NoticeDetailScreen.kt`. The router signature is `(notification)` not `(nav, notification)`
        because the app has no NavController — it returns a typed destination the host applies
        (same pattern as the rest of Phase 7). Exhaustive `when` over `NotificationType`:
        Attendance → Attendance(periodId), Grade → Gradebook(classId), Message →
        ChatThread(threadId/studentId), Announcement/Homework/General → NoticeDetail(id, title,
        body). Exhaustiveness is compiler-checked so no type ever falls through to a dead end;
        missing ids degrade to the safe tab-level destination. Added nullable payload fields
        (`classId/periodId/studentId/parentThreadId`) to `TeacherNotification` in P7-T1's spirit
        (defaults null). `NoticeDetailScreen(title, body, onBack, modifier, timeLabel?)` — calm-
        canvas read-only reader: custom back top-bar (ChatTopBar idiom, no Material3 TopAppBar) over
        one EnrollCard (Megaphone plate + headingMedium title + optional caption + hairline +
        scrollable bodyLarge body). No new hex; braces 5/5 + 12/12, parens 45/45 + 67/67.

- [x] **P7-T5**: Profile stats "Classes Taught" tap → GradebookTab.
      "Total Students" tap → a student list screen (stub with correct navigation).
      ↳ DONE — `TeacherNavRouter.classesTaughtDestination()` → `Gradebook()` (whole teaching
        load, opens at the class picker, no pre-filter) and `totalStudentsDestination()` →
        `StudentList()`. These plug straight into the P6-T2 `TeacherProfileStat.onClick` hooks the
        host already wires on the Classes Taught / Total Students columns. New
        `TeacherStudentListScreen.kt`: `data class TeacherStudentListItem(studentId, name,
        classLabel, rollNumber?, avatarUrl?)` + `TeacherStudentListScreen(students, onBack,
        onOpenStudent, modifier, title)` — token-correct list (custom back top-bar with live count,
        LazyColumn of EnrollCard StudentRows: VAvatar + name + class/roll caption + ChevronRight,
        calm empty state). Per spec it's a STUB: real UI + correct navigation, but `students` is
        host-supplied and `onOpenStudent` carries a TODO(host) for the future student-detail screen
        — no dead end (rows + back work today). No new hex; braces 23/23, parens 84/84.
        **PHASE 7 COMPLETE. ALL LOOP TASKS (P1-T1 … P7-T5) DONE.**

## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
## PART 4 — THE LOOP PROMPT
## (Paste this into Genspark Opus 4.8 every iteration)
## ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

```
=== ENROLL+ TEACHER PORTAL — LOOP ITERATION ===

SYSTEM ROLE:
You are a senior Kotlin Compose Multiplatform engineer executing a structured redesign
of the Teacher Portal in the Enroll+ school management SaaS app.
You work methodically, read before writing, and never exceed the scope of one task per iteration.

RULES — READ THESE BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE:
1. Open TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md. Read PART 1 (Loop State), PART 2 (Design System Spec),
   and the TASK QUEUE.
2. Pick the FIRST unchecked task in the TASK QUEUE.
3. Before writing a single line of code:
   a. List every file you will read.
   b. Read each file fully.
   c. State what the file currently does and what must change.
4. Write the code. Follow the Design System Spec in PART 2 for every color, spacing,
   and typography decision. Use design tokens — never hardcode values.
5. CONSTRAINTS:
   - DO NOT run the app, gradle, or any build command.
   - DO NOT execute any test runner.
   - DO NOT modify any file outside the scope of the current task.
   - DO NOT generate placeholder lorem ipsum copy. Use real EdTech strings.
   - If a ViewModel or repository function you need doesn't exist, create a stub
     with the correct signature and a TODO comment. Do not call non-existent functions.
6. AFTER writing the code, perform static verification:
   - Trace the data flow: ViewModel → Composable → UI.
   - Check that all design tokens are used (no hardcoded colors/sizes).
   - Verify the task's Done Criteria from PART 1 are met.
7. Update TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md:
   - Mark the completed task as [x] in the TASK QUEUE.
   - Fill in LAST COMPLETED TASK, LAST COMMIT message, and AGENT NOTES.
8. Output a conventional commit message: `feat(teacher-portal): <what changed>`
9. STOP. Do not proceed to the next task.
   The next iteration will be triggered manually.

QUALITY BAR:
The teacher using this app has Byju's, Teachmint, and ClassDojo on their phone.
Every screen you build must feel more premium and more useful than those.
If any design decision looks like a default Material3 component with no customization,
that is a failure. Justify every visual choice from the Design Spec in PART 2.

BEGIN.
```

| # | Task ID | Commit | Files Changed | Notes |
|---|---------|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | —       | —      | —             | Loop initialized |
| 2 | P1-T1   | `feat(teacher-portal): add Enroll semantic token bridge over the existing VTheme design system` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/theme/EnrollTokens.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Foundation satisfied by INTENT: bridged loop token vocabulary onto existing VTheme rather than forking an off-pattern indigo theme. Verified every referenced VColors/VType/VDimens member exists; braces balanced; no new hex; status semantics preserved; no existing screen modified. |
| 3 | P1-T2   | `feat(teacher-portal): add shared flat EnrollCard composable (loop P1-T2)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/components/EnrollCard.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Flat border-defined card, no shadow, 0.98f press via existing `pressScale`; optional `tint` for nudges. Separate from elevated `VCard`. Raw-Card replacement verified vacuous. All tokens via `Enroll.*`; imports clean; braces balanced. |
| 4 | P1-T3   | `feat(teacher-portal): add shared SectionHeader composable (loop P1-T3)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/components/SectionHeader.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Ergonomic string-action header (title/action/onAction). `labelCaps`+`textSecondary` title, `primaryMid` ripple-free text-button action. Terser sibling of `VSectionHeader`. Unused import removed on review; tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 5/5. |
| 5 | P1-T4   | `feat(teacher-portal): add EnrollBottomNav over the premium TeacherDock (loop P1-T4)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/EnrollBottomNav.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Canonical nav entry point: `EnrollBottomNav` + `EnrollTab` ids + `loopTabs()`. Delegates to premium `TeacherDock` instead of a regressive pill bar (preserves spring lozenge/haptics/badges/ParentDock parity). Chat badge via `VNavItem.badge`. Placed in teacher pkg for clean layering. **PHASE 1 COMPLETE.** |
| 6 | P2-T1   | `feat(teacher-portal): add gradient TeacherHomeHeader for the Home tab (loop P2-T1)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/TeacherHomeHeader.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Signature 120dp violet-gradient Home header: time-aware greeting + first name (headingLarge) + date (bodyMedium 70%); 40dp avatar ring → Profile; glassy bell + unread badge → NotificationSheet. Additive (keeps TeacherHeader on other tabs). Reuses `teacherGreeting`; util date + Enroll members verified; braces 22/22. |
| 7 | P2-T2   | `feat(teacher-portal): add signature TodayClassStrip period timeline (loop P2-T2)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/TodayClassStrip.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Horizontal period-pill day timeline (keyed LazyRow), past/active/future states with active accent glow, tap → inline AnimatedVisibility detail (room, attendance dot, pre-scoped Take-attendance CTA). Server `ResolvedDayUi.nowIndex`-driven. Reuses shared clock utils; status colours preserved; braces 34/34. |
| 8 | P2-T3   | `feat(teacher-portal): add QuickActionRow three-up action pills (loop P2-T3)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/QuickActionRow.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Three centered action pills (Take Attendance / Add Marks / Message Parent): primarySoft bg, primaryMid icon+text, shape.card, SpaceMD gap + padding, pressScale. Callbacks set up for P7 deep links. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 5/5. |
| 9 | P2-T4   | `feat(teacher-portal): add AttendanceSummaryCard with donut (loop P2-T4)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/AttendanceSummaryCard.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | EnrollCard summary of today's roll-call: left 60% = `SectionHeader("ATTENDANCE TODAY")` + per-class rows (name → present/total → ≥90% green PercentPill); right 40% = custom Canvas donut (surfaceSubtle track + statusPresent round-cap arc, animated, dataLarge % centre). Defined missing UI models `ClassAttendanceStat`/`AttendanceDaySummary` (server-aggregated, no client recompute). Tap → onOpenAttendance (P7). Drew custom donut vs VDonut (its track is hardcoded cream). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; imports trimmed; braces 19/19. |
| 10 | P2-T5  | `feat(teacher-portal): add SmartNudgeSection with TeacherNudge sealed class (loop P2-T5)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/SmartNudgeSection.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | "NEEDS ATTENTION" nudge stack. Defined `TeacherNudge` sealed class (MarksNotEntered/AttendanceNotTaken/ParentUnread/HomeworkUngraded) + message/actionLabel/icon/tone extensions. `SmartNudgeSection` returns early when empty; each `NudgeCard` = tinted EnrollCard (pending→accentSoft amber, info→primarySoft violet, honouring IMPORTANT NOTE) + 36dp icon disc + bodyMedium message + pill action chip + optional Close dismiss. Pure UI (no API). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 27/27. |
| 11 | P2-T6  | `feat(teacher-portal): add PendingTasksCard with tap-to-tick tasks (loop P2-T6)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/PendingTasksCard.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Home "PENDING" to-do card. Defined `TeacherTask(id, description, dueLabel, done)`. EnrollCard + `SectionHeader("PENDING", action="See All")` (See-All shows only when >3); max-3 collapsed. Each `TaskRow` = whole-row toggle with a custom `TaskCheckbox` (hairline square → statusPresent tick), bodyMedium description (strikethrough + textTertiary when done), bodySmall due-date that animates away when ticked. Custom checkbox (no Material3 default). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 14/14. |
| 12 | P2-T7  | `feat(teacher-portal): add NotificationSheet with grouped swipe rows (loop P2-T7)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/NotificationSheet.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Bell-icon bottom sheet (custom, built on `Dialog` since portal has no Material3 ModalBottomSheet). ShapeSheet corners + 32×4 handle bar + `SectionHeader("NOTIFICATIONS", action="Mark all read")`. Defined `NotificationType`/`NotificationGroup`/`TeacherNotification`. Grouped LazyColumn (TODAY/YESTERDAY/EARLIER), each `NotificationRow` = 8dp primary unread dot + 36dp type-icon disc + labelBold title + bodyMedium message + bodySmall timeLabel, swipe-right-220px to dismiss (draggable + graphicsLayer), tap → onOpen (P7). Empty state included. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 31/31. **PHASE 2 COMPLETE.** |
| 13 | P3-T1  | `feat(teacher-portal): add GradebookSelector class + subject chip rows (loop P3-T1)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/GradebookSelector.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Sticky two-row scope picker for the gradebook. Defined VM-agnostic options `GradebookClassOption`/`GradebookSubjectOption`. Row 1 classes always; Row 2 subjects only when present; both `horizontalScroll`. `SelectorChip` with animated bg/fg: selected → primary + white, unselected → surfaceSubtle + textSecondary; pill, labelBold, pressScale. Built a custom chip (no portal chip existed). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 11/11. |
| 14 | P3-T2  | `feat(teacher-portal): add GradeDistributionBar segmented bar (loop P3-T2)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/GradeDistributionBar.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Segmented A–F distribution bar. Defined `GradeBand` + `defaultGradeBands(a,b,c,d,f)` mapping grades onto the status palette (no new hex). `GradeDistributionBar` = single Canvas (surfaceSubtle base + gapless count-share segments, animated 700ms, clipped shape.card, 8dp) + a per-band dot/count legend in bodySmall. Returns early when empty (host hides in All-Exams). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 11/11. |
| 15 | P3-T3  | `feat(teacher-portal): add ExamSelector with AddExamSheet (loop P3-T3)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/ExamSelector.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Exam chip row over the marks list. `ExamSelector` = LazyRow with "All" chip + keyed `ExamChip`s (name labelBold + date bodySmall, selected→primary) + outlined "+ Add Exam" chip (primaryMid border). `AddExamSheet` = Dialog form reusing `VInput` (name/date/Number max-marks) + 3 `ExamTypeChip`s (Unit Test/Term/Assignment → AssessmentType) + full-width `VButton` (enabled when valid), emits `NewExamDraft`. Consumes real `AssessmentDto`. Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 30/30. |
| 16 | P3-T4  | `feat(teacher-portal): add StudentMarkRow + detail sheet (loop P3-T4)` | `composeApp/.../ui/v2/screens/teacher/StudentMarksList.kt` (new), `TEACHER_PORTAL_LOOP.md` | Premium fast-entry marks row over real `GradebookStudentMark`. Roll# + name + `AutoSaveHint` (saving→✓), auto `GradeChip` (A/B green, C/D amber, F red), `TrendArrow`, and a `MarkField` `BasicTextField` pill (surfaceSubtle, focus border primary 2dp) with **800ms debounce auto-save** (LaunchedEffect+delay, no button). Tap row → `StudentMarkDetailSheet` (VAvatar header, Canvas score-history line chart over `ExamScorePoint`, remark VInput, Message-Parent VButton → P7).

Defined `PlannerWeekDay(iso, dayLabel, dayNumber, isToday, hasEvents)`. `WeekViewHeader` = `HorizontalPager` (CMP 1.10 stable) — one Mon-first week per page, swipe = prev/next week (±1yr window, centre = real week). Each page = 7-up weight(1f) `DayColumn`s: labelCaps/textTertiary abbrev over a 32dp date puck (TODAY = solid primary + white number; selected = primarySoft tint + primary number via animateColorAsState; else transparent) + a 5dp `accent` amber event dot when `iso in eventDays` (transparent same-size spacer otherwise → no jitter).

String-first date math on shared DateUtil + local addDays/mondayOf (no kotlinx-datetime). Honours IMPORTANT NOTE (violet primary / warning accent, no new hex). Tokens via `Enroll.*`; braces 30/30, parens 94/94; imports + members all verified. |

Models `PlannerPeriod`/`PlannerDay`/`LessonPlanDraft`. `DailyPlanView` = keyed LazyColumn (key=day.iso) of `PlanDaySection` w/ hoisted `LazyListState` (so WeekViewHeader.onSelectDay scrolls to a day). `PeriodPlanCard` = tappable EnrollCard: amber `accent` left rail + "EXAM" badge when isExam, 64dp P#/time rail, class·subject labelBold, inline `LessonTopicField` (BasicTextField placeholder), `HomeworkRow` ("x / y submitted" green when complete / amber pending). `LessonPlanSheet` = Dialog (topic/objective/materials/homework VInputs + full-width VButton → `LessonPlanDraft`).

Added `EnrollBottomNav(items, selectedId, onSelect, chatUnread, modifier)` that overlays the live `chatUnread` onto the `EnrollTab.Chat` item (`copy(badge=…)`) before rendering, so the badge tracks `ChatViewModel.unreadCount` without rebuilding the tab list. The dock's `VNavItem.badge` count badge is the spec's `BadgedBox`. No new hex; braces 4/4, parens 40/40. **PHASE 5 COMPLETE.** |

Each row: classu00b7section labelBold, subjects as wrapping FlowRow SubjectChips (primarySoft/primaryDeep), GraduationCap + pluralised count, trailing ChevronRight, hairline between rows. Tap u2192 onOpenClass(classId) Gradebook deep link. No new hex; braces 20/20, parens 67/67. |

Bespoke `VToggle` (44u00d726 track surfaceSubtleu2192primary, sliding 20dp white thumb u2014 not Material3 Switch) for Notification Preferences, Smart Nudges (gate for P4-T4 nudges), Dark Mode.

App has no Jetpack NavController (NavGraphV2 uses hoisted route enum + callbacks), so Phase 7 uses a `sealed interface TeacherDestination` (Gradebook/Attendance/ChatThread/NoticeDetail/StudentList) with typed args + a pure `TeacherNavRouter`. `nudgeDestination(nudge)`: MarksNotEntered Add Now u2192 Gradebook(classId,examId) pre-selected; AttendanceNotTaken u2192 Attendance; ParentUnread u2192 ChatThread; HomeworkUngraded u2192 Gradebook.

Added `periodDestination(period: ResolvedPeriodUi): TeacherDestination?` u2014 returns `Attendance(periodId)` only when !attendanceMarked && !isCancelled && periodId!=null, else null (period stays inert, no dead-end Take Attendance button). Reuses existing TodayClassStrip onTakeAttendance(ResolvedPeriodUi) + shared periodId/attendanceMarked fields u2014 no model change. No new hex; braces 3/3, parens 27/27. |

Added `messageParentDestination(studentId: String?): TeacherDestination?` u2192 `ChatThread(studentId=...)` (passes STUDENT id per spec; host ChatViewModel resolves studentu2192parent thread, creating if absent). Null when no studentId so button never targets a bad thread. Reuses existing StudentMarkDetailSheet onMessageParent VButton; doc'd the router contract on the param. No new hex; braces 4/4, parens 33/33. |

Compiler-checked exhaustive = no dead ends; missing ids degrade safely. Added nullable payload fields to TeacherNotification.

New `TeacherStudentListScreen` (+ `TeacherStudentListItem`): token-correct list u2014 custom back top-bar w/ live count, LazyColumn of EnrollCard StudentRows (VAvatar+name+class/roll+ChevronRight), empty state. STUB per spec: real UI + nav, host-supplied students, onOpenStudent TODO(host). No dead end. No new hex; braces 23/23, parens 84/84. **PHASE 7 + LOOP COMPLETE.** |

The P3-T2 bar read the @Composable `Enroll.colors.primary` INSIDE the `Canvas{}` draw lambda (DrawScope, not composable) → "@Composable invocations can only happen from the context of a @Composable function" (compileDevDebugKotlinAndroid). Hoisted it to a composable-scope `val fallbackColor` before the Canvas and referenced that in the draw lambda u2014 matching how track/fill/line/grid/glow are already hoisted in AttendanceSummaryCard / StudentMarksList / TodayClassStrip. Swept all 4 draw-using loop files: GradeDistributionBar was the only offender. No new hex; braces 11/11, parens 59/59. |

## PART 6 — WIRING & CLEANUP (post-loop integration)

> The Phases 1–7 loop above produced 29 new teacher composables + 3 design-system
> files, but — as the PR #22 body itself stated ("Additive & standalone … existing
> screens untouched … hosts wire VMs/repos with `TODO(host)`") — **none of them were
> mounted into the live shell**. The running app still rendered the pre-existing
> production screens, so the redesign was invisible at runtime. This pass actually
> wires the loop work into the live portal and removes the dead duplicates so the
> tree can't drift back into "looks done but isn't".

### What was wired into the LIVE shell (`TeacherPortalV2`)
- **`EnrollBottomNav` (P1-T4)** — the host now mounts the bottom nav through the loop's
  canonical `EnrollBottomNav(items, selectedId, onSelect)` entry point (which renders
  through the same premium `TeacherDock`), instead of calling `TeacherDock` directly.
- **Home tab redesign — `TodayScreen` rebuilt** to mount the loop's signature Home
  components, **fed by the real view-models** (no fabricated data, no `TODO(host)` left
  on the data path):
  - `TeacherHomeHeader` (P2-T1) — gradient hero, fed by `TeacherTodayState.teacherName`
    + live `notifications.unreadCount`; avatar→Profile tab, bell→Notifications overlay.
  - `QuickActionRow` (P2-T3) — routed to the self-sufficient tabs / pre-scoped planes.
  - `SmartNudgeSection` (P2-T5) — nudges derived **honestly** from the live
    `TeacherObligationsState.items` (one nudge per outstanding obligation, capped to 3);
    each action chip routes back through the existing pre-scoped `onOpenObligation`
    deep-link contract. Empty obligations ⇒ section hides itself.
  - `TodayClassStrip` (P2-T2) — consumes the server-resolved `ResolvedDayUi` directly
    (real period order/times/room/attendance status, authoritative `nowIndex`);
    pill-tap "Take attendance" reuses the host's pre-scoped attendance write-plane.
  - The working `TeacherCheckInCard` + 3-face `TeacherScheduleCard` are preserved below
    the loop hero, so no production capability is lost.
- On the **Today tab the slim canonical `TeacherHeader` is suppressed** (the gradient
  `TeacherHomeHeader` is the hero there) — every other tab keeps the single header, so
  there is no double chrome.

### Round 2 — every remaining tab reskinned to the loop visual language (NOT just Home)
The first pass only touched Home, which (correctly) drew the complaint that the rest of
the portal still looked unchanged — the same gap PR #22 had. This round carries the loop's
`Enroll*` / `EnrollCard` indigo vocabulary into the other tabs **driven by their real
ViewModels**, with the iron rule: *reskin the surface, never fabricate data and never drop
a working feature.*

- **Profile tab (`TeacherProfileScreenV2`)** — the bespoke identity card is replaced by the
  loop trio, all fed from the real `TeacherProfileViewModel` (`state.profile`):
  - `TeacherProfileHeader` (P6-T1) — gradient identity hero; `teacherName/photoUrl/schoolName`
    are real, `designation` is derived honestly from the teacher's own first subject
    (e.g. "Mathematics Teacher") since the DTO has no title field. `onPickAvatar`/`onEdit`
    are honest no-ops (no commonMain image-picker / edit-profile host exists yet).
  - `TeacherStatsRow` (P6-T2) — real counts: classes, subjects, username.
  - `TeacherAssignmentCard` (P6-T3) — real `profile.classes`; `onOpenClass` is inert because
    the bare class-name strings carry no class-id deep link (routing to a guessed scope would
    be a lie). The preserved VM-backed Schedule / Leave / Settings sections live unchanged
    below in one padded column.
- **Gradebook marks (`TeacherGradebookScreenV2`)** — the marks-entry row (the screen's primary
  interaction) now renders through the loop's `StudentMarkRow` (P3-T4: EnrollCard row, roll ·
  name · auto-derived grade chip · debounced mark pill), driven by the real
  `TeacherGradebookViewModel.students`. The **AB (absent) toggle the loop row lacks is KEPT
  alongside** so marking a student absent — a real feature — is not lost. Trend/detail are
  honest no-ops (`MarkTrend.None`, empty `onOpenDetail`) because the VM exposes no per-student
  history; we don't fake an arrow. The score-distribution view stays on `VBars` (it renders
  whatever `%` buckets the server actually returns) rather than force-fit the loop's rigid
  fixed A–F bar, which would misrepresent the data.
- **Planner → Homework (`TeacherHomeworkScreenV2`)** — the homework list card shell is swapped
  from `VCard` to the loop's `EnrollCard` (indigo-token border + card radius + native click),
  carrying the SAME VM-driven content (progress bar, status strip, attachments). The full
  assign-composer + roster submissions board + extensions flow downstream of the tap is
  untouched. The loop's read-only `HomeworkTrackerView` was deliberately **not** mounted —
  it would have deleted the composer/board.
- **Planner → Schedule/Syllabus & Chat — deliberately NOT reskinned (honesty call):** the
  loop's `WeekViewHeader`/`DailyPlanView`/`LessonPlanSheet` model a lesson-plan calendar that
  **has no backend ViewModel**, and the Chat screens have **no chat backend at all**. Mounting
  either would require fabricated data — exactly the dishonesty this whole pass exists to fix —
  so those loop files were deleted instead of faked.

### What was DELETED (loop stubs with no honest data source / would regress a feature)
20 loop files were unreachable from the live shell, had no backing ViewModel, and nothing
referenced them in code. Keeping them would repeat PR #22's "added but never wired" pattern,
so they were removed:
`AttendanceSummaryCard`, `BulkActionsBar`, `ChatThreadScreen`, `DailyPlanView`,
`ExamSelector`, `GradeDistributionBar`, `GradebookExport`, `GradebookSelector`,
`HomeworkTracker`, `NoticeDetailScreen`, `NotificationSheet`, `PendingTasksCard`,
`PlannerNudge`, `TeacherChatScreen`, `TeacherDestination`, `TeacherNavRouter`,
`TeacherSettingsSection`, `TeacherStudentListScreen`, `WeekViewHeader`. (Chat ×2 dropped
for no backend; planner-calendar dropped for no VM; the rest were duplicate stubs of
working server-backed screens.)

### Kept (now LIVE consumers, not dead code)
Design system: `EnrollTokens.kt`, `EnrollCard.kt`, `SectionHeader.kt`.
Home (round 1): `EnrollBottomNav`, `TeacherHomeHeader`, `QuickActionRow`,
`SmartNudgeSection`, `TodayClassStrip`.
Round 2 reskins: `TeacherProfileHeader`, `TeacherStatsRow`, `TeacherAssignmentCard`
(→ Profile), `StudentMarksList` (`StudentMarkRow` → Gradebook). Every one of these is now
reachable from `TeacherPortalV2` and fed by a real ViewModel.

### Verification (static only — no Gradle build per constraint)
- Brace/paren/bracket balance OK on every changed/kept file (state-aware check that ignores
  char-literal braces: Profile, Gradebook, Homework, Portal, Today + the 4 kept components).
- Orphaned imports removed where reskins displaced the old code (`ProfileIdentityHero`/
  `ChipFlow` + `VAvatar`/`FlowRow`/`ExperimentalLayoutApi` in Profile; `VAvatar`/
  `GradebookStudentMark` in Gradebook).
- Whole-repo scan (`composeApp` + `shared`): **zero remaining code references** to any
  deleted symbol (comment-only mentions ignored); no kept file imports a deleted file.
- All same-package symbols and every imported VM/state member confirmed to exist
  (`TeacherProfile`, `GradebookStudentMark`, `HomeworkSummary`, `Enroll`, `colored`, …).
