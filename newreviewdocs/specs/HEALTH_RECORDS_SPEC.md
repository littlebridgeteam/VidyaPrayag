# Student Health Records — Technical Specification

> **Document status:** Implemented (90%) — FR-7 (health checkup scheduling) still pending
> **Last updated:** 2026-06-28
> **Prerequisites:** None

---

## 1. Feature Overview

Student health and immunization record management: medical history, allergies, medications, immunization tracking, emergency contacts, and health incident logging.

### Goals

- Admin/nurse maintains student health profiles
- Track immunizations (vaccine, date, next due)
- Allergy and medical condition alerts (visible to teachers)
- Health incident logging (what happened, treatment, parent notified)
- Emergency contact and blood group
- Parent can view child's health records

---

## 2. Current System Assessment

- **Implemented** in commit `14a59a9` (2026-06-27) — DB migration `migration_050_health_records.sql`, Exposed tables, services, routing, and client UI all shipped
- `StudentHealthProfilesTable` (`Tables.kt`) — blood group, height, weight, allergies, chronic conditions, medications, emergency contact, doctor info
- `StudentImmunizationsTable` (`Tables.kt`) — vaccine name, dose number, date administered, next due, administered by
- `StudentHealthIncidentsTable` (`Tables.kt`) — date, time, description, treatment, medication, parent notified, severity, attended by
- `HealthRouting.kt` (`server/.../feature/health/`) — admin/nurse CRUD, teacher alerts, parent read-only endpoints
- Client UI: `HealthRecordsScreenV2.kt` (admin), `ParentHealthScreenV2.kt` (parent), `TeacherHealthAlertsScreenV2.kt` (teacher)
- Shared layer: `HealthApi.kt`, `HealthRepositoryImpl.kt`, `HealthDtos.kt`, `AdminHealthViewModel.kt`, `ParentHealthViewModel.kt`, `TeacherHealthAlertsViewModel.kt`
- FR-7 (health checkup scheduling and results) is the only remaining unimplemented requirement

| FR-4 | Allergy alerts visible to teachers on student profile |
| FR-5 | Parent can view child's health records |
| FR-6 | Emergency contact + doctor information |
| FR-7 | Health checkup scheduling and results |

## 5. API Contracts

```
# Admin/Nurse
GET/POST /api/v1/school/health/profiles/{studentId}
POST /api/v1/school/health/immunizations
POST /api/v1/school/health/incidents
GET /api/v1/school/health/incidents?student_id={uuid}&date_from={}&date_to={}

# Teacher
GET /api/v1/teacher/health/alerts  -- allergy + condition alerts for assigned classes

# Parent
GET /api/v1/parent/health/{childId}
```
